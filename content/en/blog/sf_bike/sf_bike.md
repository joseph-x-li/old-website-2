Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a lot of time on my bike. It is socially distant exercise and allows me to get away from my family for a moment.

I have been doing more long-distance rides. For example, to the SF Bay and back (~20 mi) or to Almaden and back (~30 mi). Biking to SF is triple the distance at 60 miles.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I spent a lot of time on my bike. It is socially distant exercise and allows me to get away from my family for a moment.

I had been doing more long-distance rides. SF Bay and back is roughly 20 miles. Almaden and back is roughly 30 miles. Biking to SF is triple the distance at 60 miles. I decided to go with two friends from high school.

The night before we set out, I added a little message to my bike.

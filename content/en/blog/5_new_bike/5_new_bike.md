Poseidon is a DTC (Direct To Consumer) bike manufacturer based near Los Angeles, California. The bike I purchased retails for $750 and comes with free shipping.



Cool features of this bike:  
 - Carbon fiber front fork
 - Microshift ADVENT x 10-speed (38t chainring <-> 11-48t casette)
    - This is good for Pittsburgh's and Saratoga's hilly topography.
    - Also has a clutch which is very necessary when backpedaling.
 - Dropbar (this is $100 more expensive than Flatbar -.-)
 - Mounts for front and rear racks

Upgrades:
 - Hybrid flat/clipless pedals
 - Front and rear light
 - Front and rear renders
 - Phone mount
 - Topeak Rack and Pannier

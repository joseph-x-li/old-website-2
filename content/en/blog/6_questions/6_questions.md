I can confidently say that in my twenty years of existence, nobody has changed my life as much as you have.

My parents often lament and long for the younger version of me, the elementary schooler willing to brave through ballet classes and face whatever life’s challenges with confidence. The one who always wore a huge smile on his face, showing off his prized dimples. 

For years, I had no idea where that side of me went. All I know is that a series of events altered my perceptions of trust, empathy, and self-confidence. Those pieces of me were lost over multiple years, sometimes suddenly, but most often gradually. But, in those moments, I couldn’t tell. There will come a time when I must stand up to the past, but I am still too scared to ask those questions today.  

Nevertheless, something has happened, and all I know is you’ve changed me, picked up those pieces, and made me whole.

When I entered college, I was just a silly kid who never imagined he would be lucky enough to be a part of the lives of such inspiring people. And yet, it happened. So to you and everyone who has provided the support, love, and kindness that I have never before known, I will be eternally thankful. 

In a few days, I will start my Senior year of college. These next few months will decide huge aspects of my life. I will work hard to earn an exciting job in technology; I look forward to challenging yet rewarding systems classes; but, I dread graduation day, when I will have to say so many painful goodbyes. 

I came to CMU alone. Those willing to talk with me slowly populated my life and became my most precious friends. Soon, they will all have scattered across the country, each striving for their own goals and building their own lives. When I graduate and begin my own journey, alone yet again, I promise will never forget all you have done to help me get there.

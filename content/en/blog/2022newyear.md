## New Website

This blog post is the first on a new website powered by Hugo (past posts were imported). I spent way too long looking for an alternative to the abomination that is Jekyll along with its horrific Ruby version conflicts. Having found and settled on a better format for my online presence, I have some sort of desire to find and settle on better personal goals. If you sweep the corner of a room, might as well sweep it entirely, so to say. As we approach 2022, one might call these goals "New Year's Resolutions", but I'd like to avoid restricting self improvement as an annual event, even if only nominally.

## A Reflection on 2021 

The following are aspects of life I gave conscious thought to during 2021. I just said I was going to refrain from a yearly-themed self-help format, but this is just easier. Sue me.

### Human Languages
 - **Chinese:** For roughly 100 days, I kept a routine for studying Chinese vocabulary using the "Daily Chinese" app. When I entered the fall semester of my Junior year, this habit quickly fell apart due to a seemingly unrelated event: my bathroom became too close to my bed. <br></br>
 Within this experience, there is something to be said about how to consciously construct and maitain good habits. . I recently found this idea is formalized as "piggybacking" by Wendy Wood in a recent _Hidden Brain_ Podcast ["Creatures of Habit"](https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/creatures-of-habit/) 43:30, and I am sure the hundreds of other self-help literature explain a similar idea. 

 - **Japanese:** I kept up my daily Japanese lessons on Duolingo. Duolingo says I spent 3610 minutes in 2021 learning languages. I estimate 80% of that went to Japanese (rest Chinese), so we are looking at 48 hours of learning. The Duolingo streak is what keeps me going. It is not difficult to imagine how streaks motivate a daily habit, but they do require an "audience". For instance, in Snapchat, the streak's "audience" is the receiving party i.e. whoever is keeping the streak with you. This is the person who will notice that you broke a streak. For Duolingo, the concept of an "audience" doesn't really exist, at least not by default.<br></br>
 To construct an audience in Duolingo, you must add friends who are completing language lessons on the app as well. The problem is finding similarly motivated friends, which becomes a sort of chicken and egg dilemma. Even if you somehow find some friends to join you, there must be some kind of obnoxiously visual.

 One of these inexplicably  

 - **English:** My vocabulary list is built up to roughly 90 words, starting at "abstruse" and ending at "vicissitude".

### Computer Languages
 - `C`: I spent a week 
 - `C++`: I spent a week 
 - `Rust`: I spent a week 
 - `Python`: I spent a week 

## Goals for 2022

### Human Languages
 - **Chinese:**
 - **Japanese:**
 - **English:**

### Computer Languages
 - `C`: Either I will need this a lot, or not at all, at my Nvidia internship. I hope its the former since I am sick of writing long-ass Python scripts.
 - `C++`: I spent a week 
 - `Rust`: Take Cooper's "Shilling the Rust Language" Stuco. Contribute to some open source projects.
 - `Python`: Try out Cython and successfully create and link a Rust/C++/C extension to Python. This could be done by writing a simple C extension into pystreaming.

### Habits
 - Don't use your phone while trying to sleep. I did well in 2021, let's see how it goes in 2022. 
 - Actually go to lectures, or at least wake up before lectures begin. The 8:30am compilers lecture is gone, so there is no excuse now.
 - No eating snacks, especially close to bedtime. Possibly enforce this by throwing away existing snacks then bankrupting myself so that I cannot buy more.

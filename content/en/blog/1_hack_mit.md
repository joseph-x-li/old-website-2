We won the NASDAQ challenge for compensating for audio delay in livestreamed music. The motivation behind this project was to coordinate music-related events during COVID social distancing. Think bands or acapella groups (shoutout to [joyful noise](https://cmujoyfulnoise.com/)).

We can now put our picture on the NASDAQ New York Billboard. Kinda weird to see my face in New York. Eddie says he will go take a picture of it (he lives in NJ).

Also, we get to chat with the CTO of NASDAQ. I should think of some good questions to ask.

China observers that I follow.

| Author | Content | Lean | Description |
|------|------|------|------|
| Alex Lo  <br></br> *SCMP* | [SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/author/alex-lo) | China | Lo is a columnist at the South China Morning Post, a Hong-Kong based newspaper. Read this man to get SCMP's hottest takes. How he has not been fired is beyond me. During the Hong Kong Protests, Lo was likely the only author in the SCMP critical of the protestors. His writing style is conversational and often punctuated with references to philosophers, which I often struggle to understand. |
| Zhichen Wang <br></br> *Pekingnology* | [Substack](https://pekingnology.substack.com/) | China | ... |
| Jon Y <br></br> *Asianometry* | [Substack](https://asianometry.substack.com/) <br> [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Asianometry) | Neutral | Jon Y is a explainer who excels in profiling industry developments Asia, focusing mostly on China and Taiwan. The newsletter takes a deep dive into a typically recent subject; this acts as a script for his Youtube channel where narration overlays a slideshow. I am a patreon of Asianometry as I believe it is the least biased Asia explainer channel on Youtube. |
| David Ownby <br></br> *Reading the China Dream* | [Website](https://www.readingthechinadream.com/) | Neutral | Ownby is a Professor of History at the University of Montreal. Ownby and his team translate Chinese-language opinion articles authored by respected Chinese scholars. Articles selected for translation are typically highly topical in China's domestic environment, and are thus a good barometer for the current prevailing Chinese domestic policy concerns. |

Music comprises a large part of North Korean culture. Professional groups, often organized by the government, produce and perform various styles including soviet-inspired patriotic songs, emotional opera pieces, or even catchy and motivational disco tunes. These songs are played throughout the day in buildings, on transit, or even just in public. Given music is such an important aspect of North Korean life, it is invariably used to promote the image of the DPRK's leaders, the party itself, and concepts such as Socialism. Though the lyrics may seem strange, distasteful, or even offensive to some, if you keep an open mind, you may still be able to enjoy the beautiful music and perhaps witness a slice of life in North Korea.

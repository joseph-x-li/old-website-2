## About

Have you ever eaten food? Well this machine is the perfect device for YOU! Our project elevates instant ramen to a new plane of excellence. Perfect for the typical college student in functionality and aesthetic.

## How it works

Servo-activated noodle dispenser opens door to allow uncooked noodles to slide into boiling water.  
Another servo-activated cup dispenses MSG-based flavor powder into water to create broth.

### Electronics

We used an arduino to control three servos and a water pump.

### Egg Cracker

A key innovation was the creation of an egg cracker, which allows a fresh poached egg to be included in your gourmet meal. I 3d-printed the cracking arm and built the structure out of LEGO beams I brought from home.

The entire machine is closable, for easy and discrete   storage in compact college dorms. This is especially important when the dorm does not allow rice cookers.

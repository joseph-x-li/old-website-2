## About

**Location:** Gainesville, Florida  
**Owner:** Konwoo Kim and his family  
**Breed:** Domestic Shorthair  
**Sex:** Female  

Mimi is a very very very cute Domestic Shorthair. I proposed to Mimi, but Konwoo tells me that she is not interested. According to Konwoo, her name is a product of her adoption. She was the second cat in a litter that was named "Eenie" "Meeny" "Miny" et. al. After being adopted, her name was slightly modified from "Meeny" to "Mimi".
